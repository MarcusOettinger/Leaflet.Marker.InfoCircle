# Leaflet.Marker.InfoCircle
A circular marker for [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/) displaying text or numbers.
This marker is a dead simple marker similar to [L.CircleMarker](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html#circlemarker)
with an arbitrary string showing in the center. It does one thing only without any buzz or glizz - give simple
(short, that is) pieces of information directly on  a map.

See the markers in action at the [demo page](https://MarcusOettinger.github.io/Leaflet.Marker.InfoCircle/ "Demo page").

I created the plugin because I needed a simple way to display measurement data in an
area and found existing ones to be a bit too heavy.

## Usage
is simple: just grab Leaflet.Marker.InfoCircle.js and Leaflet.Marker.InfoCircle.css
and include them, use the css file for styling of the marker.
